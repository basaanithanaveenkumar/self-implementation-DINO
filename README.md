# self-implementation-DINO
A from-scratch PyTorch implementation of DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) for self-supervised learning with Vision Transformers. This repository provides a clean, research-oriented codebase designed for experimentation, customization, and deeper understanding of the DINO methodology.

What is Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)?

Self-Supervised Learning is a paradigm in machine learning where a model learns representations from unlabeled data by creating its own supervision signal from the data itself.

The core idea is simple yet powerful:

    Take your raw, unlabeled data (e.g., a massive collection of images from the internet).

    Create a "pretext task"â€”an artificial task where the label is generated automatically from the data.

    Train a model to solve this pretext task.

    Discard the task-specific head and use the learned internal representations (the "features" or "embeddings") for a downstream task you do care about (e.g., image classification, object detection) with very little labeled data.
